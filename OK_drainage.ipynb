{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["These sets of codes were made on 7/5/2025. The objective was to estimate the drainage rates using the daily reference temperature differential data collected at the 60-cm depth from the Oklahoma Mesonet sites. The loaded files include matlab files containing the temperature differential data (from the MesoSoil database) and a csv file containing the Rosetta3-derived water retention, K0, and L parameters. The Rosetta3 parameters were used to estimate the fitted parameters K0 and L using Rosetta1 run in Windows 98. Using the C2 model in Rosetta1 (old version), the Rosetta3 hydraulic parameters were manually added to generate K0 and L. The codes to generate the Rosetta3 parameters are in K_MesoSoilv2.0.ipynb."],"metadata":{"id":"tAbuXTGg3ZeC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Checking the system version used\n","import sys\n","print(sys.version)"],"metadata":{"id":"zcuycHlDaqSv","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751772425690,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Mark Anthony Barbadillo","userId":"04887954959488471315"}},"outputId":"b64ae0be-3449-40bb-8a1b-d3c25ae0e103"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["3.11.13 (main, Jun  4 2025, 08:57:29) [GCC 11.4.0]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"68QPKu0yvEyw"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.flush_and_unmount()\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)\n","os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/GW_project/GWP/')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"F76YKGPj7d73","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751772534685,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1383,"user":{"displayName":"Mark Anthony Barbadillo","userId":"04887954959488471315"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.io import loadmat    # handles matlab files"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
